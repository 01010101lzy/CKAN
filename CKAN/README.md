The CKAN client is written in C#, and targets Mono 4.0.

If you're working under Linux, you may find the `monodevelop`
package is beneficial for coding and compiling the project.

We use `nuget` for package management. There is also an
[add-on for monodeveloper](http://askubuntu.com/questions/481002/how-to-install-nuget-addin-for-monodevelop)
that can be installed.

The `packages/` directory are all installed via nuget. See the individual licenses
inside those for details.
